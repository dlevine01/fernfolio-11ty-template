    "summary": "I use spatial analysis, mapping, and data science to understand and interpret interlocking urban challenges. \nI work with communities to identify challenges, communicate needs, and advocate for reform. \nThrough grounded research and effective communication, I effect policy change and practical reform.",
    "longer": "I've worked with city and community leaders to plan public transit expansion, partnered with state legislators to build data-driven policies for choosing infrastructure projects, and supported impactful research on climate policy. \nI've added vital insights to a neighborhood information platform. I've used data science and spatial analysis tools to evaluate city policies, forecast future growth, and benchmark equity of programs and services. \nI'm always looking for ways to put these skills to work in support of community change.
