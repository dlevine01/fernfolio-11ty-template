##### I help to build more resilient, equitable cities by reshaping city policy. 

I use spatial analysis, mapping, and data science to understand and interpret interlocking urban challenges.

Through grounded research and effective communication, I bring about policy change and practical reform. 

I work with communities to uncover issues, convey local needs, and advocate for policy change.
