summary: For a groundbreaking report guiding Hawaii to its ambitious, 100% clean energy goal, I modeled aviation and marine emissions to make policy recommendations for these sectors. I studied current emissions, viable technologies, feasible resource availability, and state policy levers that could reduce carbon pollution while enabling necessary transportation to the remote island state.
