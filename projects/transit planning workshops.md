##### Problem:

In mid-sized, car dependent cities, transit commuters are bogged down by slow service while ambitious plans for urban growth are stunted by inadequate transportation options.  

Improving public transit depends on local elected, community, and business leaders joining together to prioritize these changes.

##### Solution: 

I led a series of workshops to help community leaders understand how public transit worked in their regions and tangible ways to improve service (and pay for it). 

##### Results: 
 These workshop trained and knit together multi-sector coalitions in Indianapolis, Raleigh, Cleveland, Nashville, Cincinnati, and Toledo.   Participants launched campaigns that secured:

- [$2.3 billion](https://www.wral.com/wake-approves-tax-hike-for-transit-plan/16215039/) for new bus rapid transit and commuter rail, as well as major upgrades to existing bus service, in the Raleigh region
- approval and dedicated local funding for bus service improvements and new lines in [Indianapolis](https://t4america.org/2016/05/11/after-city-council-action-indy-voters-will-decide-on-expanding-and-improving-regional-transit-this-november/)
- a $100 million annual [boost](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/cincinnati-voters-raise-sales-tax-fund-public-transit-sorta/578035/) to transit funding in Cincinnati
