This is my portfolio [site](danlevine.work). It uses Eleventy to build a static site from Markdown files and Nunjucks templates, along with plain CSS files and static resources. The site is built and deployed from this repo on Netlify. 

It is based on this [template](https://github.com/tylerMRoderick/fernfolio-11ty-template), then I did some work to customize the look and content.
